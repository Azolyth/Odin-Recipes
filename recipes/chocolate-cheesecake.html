        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You may know it as chocolate delight or chocolate lush, but while this dessert has many names, the recipe
            rarely varies.
            Traditionally, it starts with a salty nut base, followed by a mixture of cream cheese and Cool Whip, a layer
            of
            boxed-mix chocolate pudding, and then even more Cool Whip. This from-scratch version starts with a crumbly
            pecan
            shortbread, which adds texture and salt. The homemade pudding tastes of deep, dark chocolate and serves as
            the perfect
            contrast to the simple no-bake cheesecake layer. Gilding the lily with freshly whipped cream and chocolate
            shavings
            isn’t imperative, but it certainly takes it to another level.</p>

        <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the crust: In a large bowl, combine the flour, pecans,
                salt and melted butter; mix
                with a fork until everything is evenly moistened. Tip the mixture into an 8-by-8-inch baking
                dish and spread into an
                even layer. Press the mixture into a flat, even layer using your fingertips. Bake until dry
                and golden, about 25
                minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>While the crust cools, prepare the cheesecake layer: In a large bowl with an electric mixer
                on medium, beat the cream
                cheese and confectioners’ sugar until fluffy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in the
                vanilla. In a separate bowl, beat
                the heavy cream with an electric mixer on medium until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped
                cream into the cream cheese
                mixture. Spread evenly over the prepared crust. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1
                1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Prepare the pudding: Set the chopped chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Place a
                fine-mesh sieve over the bowl and
                set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch and
                salt. Add the milk, little by
                little, while whisking to incorporate it fully. Whisk in the egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Heat the mixture over medium, whisking constantly, until it has thickened and just come to a
                low boil. Continue to cook
                the pudding, whisking, for another minute, then immediately pour it into the sieve, pushing
                it through with a small
                spatula. Let the pudding stand for 1 minute, then whisk it with the butter and chocolate
                until smooth. Refrigerate until
                cool, about 1 hour. (To speed up the process, spread the pudding into an even layer on a
                rimmed baking sheet. Stir often
                until the pudding has cooled, about 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Whisk to remove any lumps that may have formed while cooling. Dollop the cold pudding over
                the top of the cheesecake.
                Carefully spread the pudding out into an even layer. Cover and chill until set, at least 4
                hours and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Whip the remaining heavy cream and confectioners’ sugar to stiff peaks. Spread on top of the
                pudding. Garnish with
                chocolate shavings and cut into squares to serve.</li>

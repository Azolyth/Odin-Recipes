    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The story goes that Pavlova, a dessert which both Australia and New Zealand lay claim to, is named after the
      prima
      ballerina Anna Pavlova, who performed in both countries in the 1920s. Ms. Pavlova’s tutu, billowing round with
      layers of
      lace, is the inspiration for the creamy meringue dessert. This simple version combines a crackled, speckled
      meringue
      disk — crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside — and a swoopy crown of salted whipped cream. Fans of the
      marshmallows
      in Lucky Charms cereal will delight in this four-ingredient Pavlova, whose flavor is reminiscent of those hearts,
      stars
      and horseshoes. Here, the “cookies” in cookies-and-cream are, as ever, Oreos, which lend that dreamy teeter-totter
      of
      milky white and bittersweet black.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>FOR THE MERINGUE: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large egg whites</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup/151 grams granulated sugar</li>
      <li>10 chocolate sandwich cookies (113 grams), such as Oreos</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>FOR THE TOPPING:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups/480 milliliters heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>5 chocolate sandwich cookies (57 grams), such as Oreos</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>PREPARATION</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Make the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add the egg whites and salt.
        Whisk on
        medium speed until frothy, about 1 minute. While the machine is still going, slowly add the sugar in a narrow
        stream,
        then raise the speed to high. Whisk the egg whites until glossy, stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. When you
        lift the
        whisk out of the bowl and turn it upside-down, a meringue mountain peak should form without flopping over.</li>
      <li>Coarsely crush or chop the 10 cookies and add to the meringue. Gently stir with a rubber spatula or large
        metal spoon
        until the cookies ripple throughout.</li>
      <li>Mound the meringue onto the center of the parchment-lined sheet pan and, using the spatula or spoon, gently
        form into a
        round that’s about 8 to 9 inches wide and 2 to 3 inches high. You can encourage this shape by repeating a
        circular
        motion that swirls the meringue and creates lovely waves so the surface doesn’t look smooth. When you’re happy
        with your
        disk, make one final circular motion in the center to create an indent, where you’ll pool the whipped cream
        later.</li>
      <li>Bake the meringue for 1 1/2 hours, then turn off the oven, leaving the door shut, and let the meringue finish
        cooking in
        the residual heat until crisp and dry on the outside with a springy, marshmallowy interior (but it should not be
        wet),
        15 to 30 minutes. Remove the meringue from the oven and let it sit on the counter to cool completely.</li>
      <li>While the meringue cools, make the topping: In a large, clean bowl or in the stand mixer (with a clean bowl),
        whisk
        together the heavy cream, sugar and salt until billowy soft peaks form. When you turn the whisk upside-down, a
        peak of
        cream should flop over slightly like a Santa hat.</li>
      <li>Pile the whipped cream on top of the cooled meringue, leaving a border, and top the cream with the 5 cookies,
        crushing
        them over the cream with your hands or chopping them and sprinkling them on top. Slice and serve the Pavlova
        like a
        cake.</li>
    </ol>
